    <li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in pasta and return to a boil. Cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup pasta water, drain pasta, and set aside.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2</strong>: Add tomato sauce, Cantanzaro herbs, sugar, salt. and pepper to the pot; bring to a simmer over medium-low heat.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 3</strong>: Meanwhile, cut each meatball into 4 pieces. Roll each piece into a mini meatball. Drop meatballs into sauce; simmer until heated through, about 10 minutes. If sauce seems too thick, thin out by adding pasta water, 1 tablespoon at a time.</li> 
    <li><strong>Step 4</strong>: Stir in cooked pasta rings. Garnish with basil leaves and Parmesan shavings and serve immediately.</li>
